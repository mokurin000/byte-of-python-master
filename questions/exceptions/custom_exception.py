# By inherinting `Exception`, you can define your custom Exceptions.
# This is mainly for error handling in complicated projects, so
# this section is optional but important.
#
# Your task is to define a custom `Exception`, or we say, a subclass of `Exception`
#
# It could contain some information, you would unlikely extract fields by desturct a string
# you just formatted somewhere else.
# To complete this, you must write some practicle code, thus you need to handle errors gracefully.
