Description

Given a number n, you should find a set of numbers for which the sum equals n.

This set must consist exclusively of values that are a power of 2

(eg: 2^0 => 1, 2^1 => 2, 2^2 => 4, ...).

For example, 15 = 8 + 4 + 2 + 1,

We don't know array yet, so we just output each power of 2:

input:
```text
15
```

output:
```text
8
4
2
1
```

"""

num = int(input())
